// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
//
//Brian Casebier pseudocode for Exercise 1
//
//Initialize variables

//Calculate sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
//
//Brian Casebier pseudocode for Exercise 2
//Initialize variables

// Exercise 3: 
//Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    
//
// a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
// b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
// c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
// d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
